EMMA can grant a ['grace period'][link-grace-period] of up to 2 years. During this 'grace period' the mice will be archived by EMMA but will not be published on the EMMA homepage. If you wish to make use of the 'grace period', you can either complete the respective fields in the [submission form][link-submission] or send an [e-mail][email-emma] and briefly explain why you need it.
