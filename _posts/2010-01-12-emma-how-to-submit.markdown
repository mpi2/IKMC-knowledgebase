On the INFRAFRONTIER [home page][link-infrafrontier] you can find a [submission form][link-submission], which you should complete and send to EMMA via the website. On the submission form you will be asked to give contact information, the type and description of your mutation, the phenotype and genetic background of your mouse, the sanitary status, literature information (PubMedIDs), information on scientific interest and intellectual property rights and some additional information needed for handling the mice.

Upon sending your submission you will receive an automatic email notification. Applications for archiving are evaluated by an external Evaluation Committee and, if the information provided through the submission form is clear enough, EMMA will contact you within 60 days and discuss how to proceed. Do not hesitate to contact INFRAFRONTIER if there are questions you would like to address in advance.
