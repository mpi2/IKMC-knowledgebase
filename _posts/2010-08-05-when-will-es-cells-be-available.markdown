We do a mycoplasma assay on all our clones and one genotype verification using a short-range PCR method. This will take 2-3 more weeks.  The parental cell line used to generate the knockout cells has been fully MAP tested, and the actual cells you will be sent will have undergone a mycoplasma check, plus will have been re-genotyped to confirm the right vial was pulled.  
The EUCOMM cells from this resource are routinely injected at 6 European sites as part of the EUMODIC program, with every centre checking every single line they receive (around 40 per month in total) by PCR-MAP testing and weâ€™ve not seen any problems yet. However, as the cells have been manipulated in the production and distribution labs since the last MAP test, we always suggest you conduct your own tests.
