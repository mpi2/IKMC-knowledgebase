The EMMA institutions CNR-Monterotondo, Italy, and MRC-Harwell, UK, offer training courses that are, in part, financed by EMMA. The Monterotondo courses are organized by the CNR-IBC in collaboration with the Jackson Laboratories. European participants can apply for financial support provided by the EMMA network. The MRC-Harwell courses are hosted by the Mammalian Genetics Unit's Frozen Embryo & Sperm Archive (FESA) and were initiated within the [EUMORPHIA][link-eumorphia] framework. For details on both courses please check the [EMMA course schedule][link-emma-courses].
