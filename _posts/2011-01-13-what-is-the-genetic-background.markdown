The mouse model the MGP sends will be supplied with an information sheet relating to the genetic background. This details contributing elements such as the Embryonic Stem Cell origin, Test Cross for germ line transmission and subsequent backcrossing that may have been carried out.

The genetic background of the mice is a combination of these with the most recent backcross shown as the first background reading from left to right for example C57BL/6J-TyrC-Brd.C57BL/6N where the **C57BL/6J-TyrC-Brd** is the latest background to be introduced. The genetic background of the mouse can be an important factor to the research undertaken and can potentially have an effect on the phenotype or may alter the parameters that have been established for control data.

**The breeding strategy to be implemented depends on the outcomes to be achieved and whilst WTSI MGP has provided the mice, WTSI MGP cannot provide more extensive advice. Maintenance of a colony received from WTSI MGP is the Recipients responsibility. However any deviations from the colony supplied should be reflected by renaming the resultant colony to identify the divergence from the originating WTSI MGP colony**
