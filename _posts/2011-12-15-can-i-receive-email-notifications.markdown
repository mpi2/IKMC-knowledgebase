Yes. To see what products are available go to the [IMPC website][link_impc_products] and search for your gene of interest using the Product Search box. 

To see the production status for a gene you can search the [IMPC website][link_impc_genes] for your gene of interest. There will be a Register Interest link. Follow that link to register interest. You will receive email notification as soon as products for your gene are available.
