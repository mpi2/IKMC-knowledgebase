Yes. For KOMP products go to the [KOMP Repository website][link_komp] and search for your gene of interest using the Product Search box. For genes for which KOMP targeting is in progress, there will be a Register Interest link. Follow that link to register interest. You will receive email notification as soon as KOMP products for your gene are available. Similar functionality will be implemented for the EUCOMM and NorCOMM projects as well.
