The WTSI MGP generates mutant mouse lines using ES cell resources from the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis programme (**EUCOMM** [www.eucomm.org][link-eucomm] ) and Knockout Mouse Project (**KOMP** [www.komp.org][link-komp] ). ES cells may be obtained by the scientific community from these sources.

The mutant mouse lines generated at WTSI are used for primary phenotypic characterisation studies. As these lines are generated, WTSI is eager to provide these mice directly to the scientific community should mice be available. However, WTSI does not breed the mutant lines specifically for distribution. Recently WTSI has become a European Mouse Mutant Archive (**EMMA**; [www.emmanet.org][link-emma] ) partner and is actively freezing down embryos and depositing them in other EMMA nodes for sustainable distribution to the scientific community. Mutant lines are reported as existing at the EUCOMM website at a very early stage, just after germ line transmission has been achieved, consequently there may be a 6-12 month lag before embryos become available. 

Please note that for the mice supplied to the scientific community by WTSI:

 * The structure of the targeted mutation in the ES cells obtained from EUCOMM or KOMP to generate these mutant mice is not verified by the WTSI MGP. It is recommended therefore that the recipient confirms the mutation structure.
* The genetic background for the mice supplied may be mixed. The use of a pure genetic background is in progress for future lines.
* The current level of quality control (QC) performed before the mice are released is to:
    * Confirm the individual mouse genotype by short-range PCR and/or quantitative PCR (qPCR) by counting the copy number variation of the neo marker.
    * Confirm location of the targeted mutation by either long-range PCR or by the detection of homozygous mice by gene specific SR-PCR
