Due to the high-throughput nature of the IKMC efforts, no special efforts for individual genes can be pursued if there are experimental problems with the targeting effort for that gene. Therefore, it is currently difficult to provide production timelines . If successful, there is a 60% chance that targeting will be completed after 6 month, and an 80% chance that it will be completed after 9 month. There will be instances where the targeting effort will take longer or not succeed at all. Once the mutant ES cells are ready they will be transferred from the production centers to the corresponding KOMP, EUCOMM, and NorCOMM Repositories which are responsible for distributing KOMP products.
