The IKMC Project has been complete and no more Targeting Vectors or ES Cells will be constructed by the IKMC.

All available ES cells, and Targeting Vectors have been transferred by the production centers to the corresponding KOMP, EUCOMM, and NorCOMM Repositories which are responsible for distributing products.

The [IMPC][link-impc] are continuing to convert ES Cells into mice for distribution through KOMP Repository and EMMA. From 2016 the IMPC mouse production effort has switched to producing mutant mice using CRISPR CAS9 technology. The IMPC no longer plan to use the IKMC ES Cell resource in there high-throughput pipeline to produce mice but will produce mice from ES Cells on request from the scientific community.
