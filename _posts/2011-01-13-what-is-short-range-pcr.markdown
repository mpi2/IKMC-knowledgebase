SR-PCR genotyping uses a combination of separate PCR reactions that detect the presence/absence of the cassette lacZ (confirms the presence of the cassette), the gene-specific wild type allele and the gene-specific mutant allele by short range PCR. 

Interpretation of the consolidated results produces the genotype of the mouse:

* LacZ positive, mutant positive, wild type positive = heterozygous.

* LacZ positive, mutant positive, wild type negative= homozygous.

LacZ negative, mutant negative, wild type positive= wild type.
