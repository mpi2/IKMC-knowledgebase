The ES cell lines JM8.F6, JM8.N4, and JM8A1.N3 are available from EUCOMM. Currently only the WTSI is distributing those wt ES cells. The the EuMMCR unit lab also has produced aliquots of JM8A1.N3 for distribution. However, these will be distributed as soon as these aliquots have been tested for germ line transmission (GLT).
