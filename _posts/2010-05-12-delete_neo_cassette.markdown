Yes, the targeting cassette in EUCOMM and KOMP-CSD alleles, is flanked by FRT sites, such that it can be removed independently from the critical exon by means of Flip recombination. This results in the conditional allele (tm1c in the figure). Additional information about different strategies followed by the internationl pipelines can be found at http://www.knockoutmouse.org/about/targeting-strategies
