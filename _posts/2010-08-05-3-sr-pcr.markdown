The EUCOMM  distribution laboratory (EuMMCR) performs one short-range PCR (SR-PCR) with a gene specific primer and a generic primer adjacent to the downstream loxP site.  With this PCR we show that the downstream LoxP site is in the right distance to the targeted region.

**Please Note**:

What the entire EUCOMM QC process does not account for e.g.:

* double integrations (required experiment: quantitative PCR or Southern Blot)
* integrations with homologous integration only on one side and insertion on the other (required experiment: Southern Blot)

We currently estimate that events like these will be present between 5 and 10% of the clones of the EUCOMM resource.
