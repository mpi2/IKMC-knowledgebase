EMMA charges €1100 for frozen material and €2400 for live mice. The fees levied by EMMA are used solely to meet the animal husbandry and stock replacement costs. In addition to these EMMA service fees customers have to cover all the shipping costs. In case of cancellations of service requests, EMMA reserves the right to charge customers for incurred costs. The individual EMMA nodes will each bill customers separately.
