### Standard fees:
On July 4th 2008 EMMA implemented a new charging scheme to reflect the change in its funding structure. Shipments of frozen embryos/sperm cost now €1100, while live mice are distributed for a cost of €1700. The €1700 covers the provision of a breeding nucleus of up to three pairs of SPF mice. The new pricing structure was introduced because the European Union no longer subsidises EMMA's distribution costs. The charges levied by EMMA are used solely to meet the animal husbandry and stock replacement costs. Customers are still asked to meet the actual costs for shipping the material from the EMMA facility to the recipient's institution.

As the default, heterozygous material is being archived and distributed. EMMA does not generally offer breeding services to e.g. generate cohorts of homozygous mutants. However, such a service and fees may be negotiated with the respective EMMA distribution centre.

Prices for **certain services** can differ from this general fee structure:

* [EUCOMM mice][link-eucomm-mice] displaying germ line transmission are distributed for a fee of €1700 as long as they are kept on shelf during the archiving process and cohort breeding.

* The [EMMA service][link-emma-service] project supports eligible customers with [free of charge Transnational Access][link-emma-transnational-access] to a defined number of requested mouse resources.

In general, service requests will not be processed until a fully executed Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) has been received (where applicable) and either a billing address or a purchase order number has been provided by the customer. In case of cancellations of service requests, EMMA reserves the right to charge customers for incurred costs. The individual EMMA repositories will each bill customers separately.
