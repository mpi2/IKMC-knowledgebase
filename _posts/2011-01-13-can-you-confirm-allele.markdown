Confirmation of the targeted mutation is determined by either long-range PCR (LR-PCR; Please see ‘What is LR-PCR?’) or by the detection of homozygous mice by gene specific short-range PCR (SR-PCR; Please see: ‘What is SR-PCR?’). If we observe homozygous mice in the colony by SR-PCR (i.e. the absence of a gene specific wild type amplicon) this is interpreted to confirm the gene has been targeted.

The LR-PCR and/or Homozygous mice observed by SR-PCR is an integral part of the WTSI MGP colony QC.
