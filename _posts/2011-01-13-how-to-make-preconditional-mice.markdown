In designing a strategy for the introduction of FlpeR and Cre lines consideration to the mutation type should be contemplated. Allele maps may be viewed at the [HTGT][link-htgt] website and searching for the gene in question and viewing the details .The clone ID used at microinjection to generate the colony relates to the appropriate mutation allele map.

The preconditional strain may be mated to a FLPeR strain to delete the region of DNA flanked by FRT sites which includes the selectable cassette. Genotype confirmation of the deletion event should be carried out. The resulting conditional strain may be further progressed to incorporate Cre deleter transgenes to remove critical coding region(s) as desired.
