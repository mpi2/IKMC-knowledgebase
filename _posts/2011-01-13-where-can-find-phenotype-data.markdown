As the mutant mouse lines generated by WTSI MGP pass through the WTSI MGP primary phenotypic characterisation studies the information generated may be viewed through the [IMPC Portal][link-impc] where the gene target in question may be searched for. A Heat Map of phenotyping by assay is also available to view via the IMPC Portal.

Enquiries regarding phenotype may be made through the contact [MGPEnquiries@sanger.ac.uk][email-sanger]

Early notification on phenotyping data, may be received by subscribing to the MGP-Early-Phenotype-Alert.

Another source of phenotype information is the [Europhenome Mouse Phenotyping Resource][link-europhenome]
