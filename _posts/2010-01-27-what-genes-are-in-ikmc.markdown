The IKMC database includes all genes from the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database for which sequences and genome coordinates are available. This includes all genes predicted by the NCBI, Ensembl, and Vega (Vertebrate Genome Annotation) pipelines for mouse Genome Build 38. MGI continuously updates its Mouse Gene Catalog by comparing gene annotations from Ensembl, Vega and NCBI, and correlating them with information in MGI. Gene model differences that are revealed by this comparison are being resolved in close collaboration with Vega, Ensembl, and NCBI.
