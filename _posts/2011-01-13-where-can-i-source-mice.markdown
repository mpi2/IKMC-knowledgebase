The mutant mouse lines generated by WTSI MGP are used for primary phenotypic characterisation studies. As these lines are generated, WTSI is eager to provide mice directly to the scientific community should mice be available. However, WTSI does not breed the mutant lines specifically for distribution.

The availability of lines, whether generated from the EUCOMM or KOMP ES cell resources may be investigated through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC; [www.mousephenotype.org][link-impc] ) website and searching for your target of interest. From here the appropriate route to register interest should be found.
