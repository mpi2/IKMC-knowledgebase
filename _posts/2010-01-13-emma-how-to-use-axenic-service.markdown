### How can I use the EMMA axenic (germ-free) service?

To use the [EMMA axenic service][link-axenic-service] you have to complete the [EMMA Axenic Service Request Form][link-request-form]. Requests will be evaluated within 30 days by the EMMA Evaluation Committee. They will be handled on a 'first come, first served' basis. You should be able to provide 6 females and 3 males, ideally of SPF status. Within this service EMMA offers to transfer 2 litters of mice into a germ-free environment and support their development to weaning age or EMMA will support the maturation of 2 female and 2 male pups up to breeding age.

The germ-free service is funded by the [European Commission's FP7 Capacities Specific Programme][link-capacities-specific-programme] and is free of charge. However, the costs of mouse transportation to and from the EMMA facilities have to be covered by the customers.

Further germ-free services including additional production, housing and experimentation can be arranged with the [collaborating institutes][link-collaborating-institutes] on a cost recovery basis.

EMMA's germ-free service is not restricted to strains that are archived with EMMA and EMMA does not require germ-free strains to be made publicly available.
