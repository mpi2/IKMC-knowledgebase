The EUCOMM production labs have MAP testing performed on the wild type ES cell stocks used in electroporations in order to generate ES cell clones.  Each individual knockout clone is not MAP tested.
The EuMMCR unit lab tests every ES cell clone that is expanded in the lab for mycoplasma infection. So far not a single ES cell clone has been mycoplasma positive.

As a quality control effort EUCOMM is producing 320 mouse lines in five mouse clinics in Europe.  One of these mouse clinics, which is currently receiving roughly 10% of the EuMMCR unit's ES cell production, has all imported ES cell clones MAP tested.
We view this quality control effort as batch testing of our ES cell production.
EUCOMM and the EuMMCR unit are committed to a very high standard of controls. However, EUCOMM and the EuMMCR unit cannot offer a "sanitary certificate" or a guaranty of any kind, since it is in the nature of the resource that the EuMMCR unit ES cells are handled in laboratories outside our supervision.
