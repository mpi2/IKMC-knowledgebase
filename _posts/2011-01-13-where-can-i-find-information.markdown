Details of the targeted allele may be viewed through the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) website ([https://www.mousephenotype.org][link-impc]), searching for the gene target in question and following the links for details on the appropriate project and allele.
The appropriate allele map may be viewed by identifying the ES cell clone used at microinjection to generate the colony (noted on the Mouse Technical Datasheet; this is an EPDnumber).

The appropriate GenBank file is also linked from this page for the ES cell clone.
