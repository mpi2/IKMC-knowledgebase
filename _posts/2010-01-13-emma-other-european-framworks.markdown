EMMA is involved in the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM). EUCOMM is a Framework Project of the European Commission aimed at building a repository of mouse stem cells, each of which contains a mutation in one of the 20,000 or so genes in the mouse genome. Within the EUCOMM consortium EMMA is responsible for quality control of targeted embryonic stem cells and for cryopreservation and distribution of mice.
