One of the methods used in the WTSI MGP QC to confirm targeting of the intended gene by the mutation cassette is LR-PCR. WTSI MGP uses 3’ LR-PCR to confirm targeting. The primers used are a the 3’ arm FRTL Universal primer (5’ primer) and either the GR3 or GR4 gene specific 3’primer that sit outside of the 3’ homology arm.

Details of these primers for the targeted mutations in KOMP and EUCOMM ES cell resources may be found through the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) website (www.knockoutmouse.org), searching for the gene target in question and following the links for details on the appropriate project and allele.
