EMMA has newly submitted strains in various stages of preservation, development and colony establishment. These strains are not yet available for distribution and can not be ordered yet. You should, however, indicate your interest in obtaining them. The 'EMMA Strain Interest Registration Form' is accessible via the 'register interest' link on the [EMMA strain list][link-emma-strian-list] and on the strain description page.

This registration of interest is valuable in helping EMMA to anticipate demand and to optimize availability of strains. Customers will receive notice as soon as the strain becomes available and be able to place their strain request in time.
