The answer to both questions is yes. IKMC welcomes gene nomination and prioritization requests from the research community. Please complete and submit the online gene nomination form [www.knockoutmouse.org/startnominategene][link-to-nominate-genes]. All submissions will be forwarded to and considered by the IKMC administrators.
