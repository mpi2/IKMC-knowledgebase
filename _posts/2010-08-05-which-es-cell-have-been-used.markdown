| WT ES Cell Line |  Background |   Remarks| 
| E14             |  129P2      |  Used for gene trap resource only. Widely used and well established. Suitable for injections on C57BL/6 blastocysts.| 
| JM8.parental    | C57BL/6N    | GLT rate determined at the WTSI for JM8.parental ES cell clones: 62%| 
| JM8.F6          |  C57BL/6N   | |     
| JM8.N4          |  C57BL/6N   | |     
| JM8A1.N3        |  C57BL/6N   |  JM8.F6 derived ES cell line by removing the retroposon element in the Agouti gene by gene targeting. These cells are heterozygous for Agouti (A/a). This provides a convenient dominant coat color marker to detect germline transmission in testcrosses to C57BL/6N mice. JM8A1.N3 cells are feeder independent. With a (so far) small number the GLT rate of JM8A1.N3 clones determined: 75%|
