The main emphasis of IKMC (as currently funded) is to generate targeting vectors and mutant ES cells. Only for a limited number of genes, mutant mice, embryos or sperm will be generated by the production centers. However, for KOMP, the KOMP Repository offers additional services, on a cost recovery basis, to obtain mice, embryos, or sperm from mutant ES cells.
