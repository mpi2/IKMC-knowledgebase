On the [INFRAFRONTIER website][link-infrafrontier] you can find a list of available strains with further information on the mouse you are interested in. When clicking on the 'order' link for the appropriate strain you will be guided to a request form which you can quickly fill in and send to INFRAFRONTIER through the website. The request form will ask you for contact information and whether you wish to receive frozen sperm or embryos or live animals. After receipt of your request, INFRAFRONTIER will contact you within two weeks.
