title:  "How long before I can receive MGP mice?"

As the WTSI MGP generates the mutant mouse lines for phenotypic analysis we are keen to offer available mice whilst on the shelf to the scientific community who have expressed an interest. However WTSI MGP is not a distribution centre that breeds for export. The mutant lines generated by WTSI MGP vary considerably in their breeding potential and we are therefore unable to predict how quickly a colony expands to both meet our own internal needs for primary phenotypic studies and the potential to supply to the scientific community who have expressed an interest in obtaining some of the mice. Colonies for which we have received expressions of interest from the scientific community are monitored on a regular basis for the potential to supply.
