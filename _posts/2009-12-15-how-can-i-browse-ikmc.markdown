You can browse the IKMC database by selecting the "Browse" tab in the upper right of the screen. You are presented two options

Browse by gene symbol
Browse by chromosome
Browsing by symbol separates the genes in the database by the first letter of the gene's official symbol. The genes are presented 50 genes at a time. Clicking on "Browse by gene symbol" brings you to the first page of genes that start with the letter "A" (case insensitive).

You are presented with navigation to go to the first page, the last page, or the previous/next page. You can jump to each letter of the alphabet (along with 0-9) by selecting the letter from the list.
