**A.**  WTSI MGP does not supply ovocytes, sperm or embryos. As the WTSI MGP generates the mutant mouse lines for phenotypic analysis WTSI MGP is keen to offer available mice whilst on the shelf to the scientific community who have expressed an interest. However WTSI MGP is not a distribution centre that breeds for export.

Lines derived from EUCOMM ES cell resources are being archived and deposited at European Mouse Mutant Archive (**EMMA**; [www.emmanet.org][link-emma] ) distribution nodes for sustainable distribution to the scientific community. Embryos if available may be sourced from here. Lines generated from KOMP ES cell resources are supplied to the KOMP Repository ([www.komp.org][link-komp]) where a range of materials may be requested.
