EMMA's primary objective is to establish and manage a unified repository for maintaining medically relevant mouse mutants and making them available to the scientific community. In essence, EMMA's main function is to archive mutant strains of mice and distribute them to researchers on request. However, EMMA also hosts courses in cryopreservation in order to promote the use and dissemination of frozen embryos and spermatozoa. Dissemination of knowledge is also fostered by a dedicated resource database.
