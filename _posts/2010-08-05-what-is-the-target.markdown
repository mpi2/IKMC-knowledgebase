Targeted traps (as we call them) differ from the intended conditional frameshift products in that the LoxP site within the 3' homology arm has not been confirmed and is likely to be missing (this seems to occur with some regularity with certain promoters). These are still potentially useful products if a conditional knockout is not required.
