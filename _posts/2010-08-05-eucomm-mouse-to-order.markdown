Yes. As part of our quality control effort, EUCOMM does produce 320 different mouse lines. EUCOMM ES cells get selected for mouse production and assigned to four of the five mouse clinics in EUCOMM.
Researchers can nominate their favourite genes to be part of this set for mouse production. After germ line transmission, mice will be expanded for the European phenotyping programm [EUMODIC][link-eumodic] and for the archiving in th European Mouse Mutant Archive [EMMA][link-emma]. Since these are long processes, the mouse line will be expanded at the EUCOMM/EUMODIC mouse clinic for roughly a year. During this year the mouse will be available “off the shelf” for 1.700 € per mouse line.
