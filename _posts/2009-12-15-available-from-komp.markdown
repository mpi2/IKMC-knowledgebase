KOMP products and services are available from the KOMP Repository. The Repository hosts the vectors, ES cells, mice, embryos, and sperm generated by the NIH KOMP Mutagenesis Project. These “products” are generated by two KOMP mutagenesis teams (the CSD consortium and Regeneron Inc). All KOMP products generated by the CSD consortium and Regeneron are available through the KOMP Repository. In addition, the KOMP Repository offers services in support of the KOMP products, including ES cell microinjection, vector cloning, post-insertional modification of cloned ES cells, cryopreservation, assisted reproduction techniques (IVF, ICSI) and mouse breeding, pathology (clinical and anatomical) pathology services, phenotyping services, etc.
