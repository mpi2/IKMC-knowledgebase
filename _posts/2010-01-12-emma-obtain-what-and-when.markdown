You can obtain sperm or embryos as frozen samples with a delivery time of four weeks. If you order live mice after rederivation EMMA will deliver within 4 to 6 months. Some strains in high demand are maintained as live colonies and can be shipped within one month. In general, service requests will not be processed until a fully executed MTA has been received (where applicable) and either a billing address or a purchase order number has been provided by the customer. Therefore please note that the delivery times given above represent the time period between the date when all paperwork is in place and the date of shipment.

Whether a strain is held as frozen material or live mice on shelf is displayed in the strain details on the EMMA strain list, under 'Availability'. Some strains require special expertise to be reliably rederived from frozen samples. Therefore, EMMA only distributes rederived mice in these cases. As default, heterozygous material is being archived and distributed.
