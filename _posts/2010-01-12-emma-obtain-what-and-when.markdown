You can obtain sperm or embryos as frozen samples with a delivery time of four weeks. If you order live mice after rederivation EMMA will provide up to three breeding pairs per mouse strain within four to six months of the request. However, some strains in high demand are maintained as live colonies and can be shipped within one month.
Some strains require special expertise to be reliably rederived from frozen samples. Therefore, EMMA only distributes rederived mice in these cases.

Whether a strain is held as frozen material or live mice on shelf is displayed on the respective strain information page of the EMMA website, under 'Availability'.

As the default, heterozygous material is being archived and distributed.
